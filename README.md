# Reinforcement Learning Collection with PyTorch

This repository is a collection of reinforcement learning algorithms: Policy-Gradient, Actor-Critic, Trust Region Policy Optimization, and Generalized Advantage Estimation. (More algorithms will be added soon...)

In this repository, [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments such as `CartPole-v0`, `Pendulum-v0`, and `BipedalWalker-v3` are used. You need to install them before running this repository.

### Future Works
- Find the errors of the Actor-Critic
- Implement PPO
- Search other environments to running the algorithms
